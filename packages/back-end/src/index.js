In 1978, Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie published the first edition of The C Programming Language.[1] This book, known to C programmers as "K&R", 
served for many years as an informal specification of the language.
The version of C that it describes is commonly referred to as K&R C. The second edition of the book[13] covers the later ANSI C standard, described below.

K&R introduced several language features:

Standard I/O library
long int data type
unsigned int data type
Compound assignment operators of the form =op (such as =-) were changed to the form op= (that is, -=) to remove 
the semantic ambiguity created by constructs such as i=-10, which had been interpreted as i =- 10 (decrement i by 10) instead of the possibly intended i = -10 (let i be -10).
